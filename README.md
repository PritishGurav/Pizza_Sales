# 🍕 Pizza Sales: My Initiatory Unguided Data Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Pizza Sales Data Analytics Project**!  
This project holds a special place in my heart as it marked the beginning of my independent journey in the world of data analytics.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Embarking on my data analytics journey, the **Pizza Sales** project revolved around analyzing a dataset from a pizza store, which I received from the **WsCube Tech** channel.  
Without step-by-step guidance, I took on the challenge of exploring the data independently, focusing on:

- **Sales Trends**: Identifying patterns in daily, weekly, and seasonal sales.
- **Customer Preferences**: Understanding the most preferred pizza types and combinations.
- **Operational Insights**: Highlighting peak sales periods and customer demographics.

  - Addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
  - Ensured the dataset was ready for meaningful analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Investigated sales distributions across different categories.
  - Analyzed customer preferences based on orders and demographics.
  - Identified peak sales periods and factors influencing high performance.
