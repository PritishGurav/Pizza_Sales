<h2>📖 Project Overview</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my <b>Pizza Sales Data Analytics Project</b> — the first step in my independent journey into data analytics!  
This project focused on analyzing sales data from a pizza store dataset provided by the <b>WsCube Tech</b> channel.  
Without any guided tutorial, I took the challenge to uncover valuable insights using <b>Python</b> and <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>.
</p>

<p>
The main objective was to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset to identify <b>sales trends, customer preferences,</b> 
and <b>operational insights</b> that could help a business optimize performance — much like a real-world scenario in the food industry.
