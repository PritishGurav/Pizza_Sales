<h2>📖 The Story Behind the Project</h2>

<p>
Every great journey starts with a small step — and mine began with a pizza! 🍕  
The <b>Pizza Sales Data Analysis</b> project was my very first <b>unguided exploration</b> into the world of data analytics.  
I wanted to see if I could take a simple business dataset and extract real, actionable insights — just like a professional data analyst.
</p>

<p>
Using data from the <b>WsCube Tech</b> channel, I decided to analyze pizza store sales to uncover patterns, customer preferences, and trends.  
With <b>Python</b> and <b>Jupyter Notebook</b> as my tools, I transformed raw data into meaningful business insights — slice by slice!
</p>

<h2>🧩 My Approach</h2>

<p>
I began by cleaning and preparing the dataset — removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.  
Then, I explored it through <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b> to find answers to questions like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which pizza types generate the highest revenue?</li>
  <li>What days or hours record the most orders?</li>
  <li>Are there specific categories or sizes customers prefer?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once I had the data ready, I visualized it using <b>Matplotlib</b> and <b>Seaborn</b> — turning numbers into stories that were easy to understand and act on.
</p>

<h2>📊 Key Findings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>🍕 <b>Top Sellers:</b> Identified the most popular pizzas and their contribution to total revenue.</li>
  <li>🕒 <b>Peak Hours:</b> Found the busiest times of the day and week for maximum sales.</li>
  <li>📦 <b>Category Insights:</b> Discovered which pizza sizes and categories performed best.</li>
  <li>💰 <b>Revenue Trends:</b> Highlighted sales patterns and potential areas for business growth.</li>
</ul>
